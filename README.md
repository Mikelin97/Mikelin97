- 👋 Hi, I’m @Mikelin97 
- 👀 Recently, me and my friend founded _**Match Box**_, a platform provides data analysis service to businesses. 

===== INTRO =====
- Our Model -> 
- **Match Box** provides its users with FREE consumer products samples such as, 
- 🍵 bags, 🤚 sanitizer, healthy snacks, anything that you can imagine fitting in a box! 
- After users received and tried out the products, they are prompted to answer a few 
- preset-comments covering basics: packaging, taste, willingness to purchase, etc. 
- Users are free to leave some comments as well~ 
- After receiving user feedbacks, we summarize and visualize the data for the 
- consumer brands who sponsored our products. 
- you are welcome to check it out in our streamlit app with a visitor account Here ⬇️⬇️⬇️
-   Web App: 121.196.227.210:8501
-   Brand: visitor
-   Password: matchbox123
- 
- Our Growth -> 
- Within 5 months, we grew from 0 to 40k users, every month we experience a 100% growth! (afterall, who doesn't like FREE things hehe 😉 
- We worked with 15+ brands, each providing at least 500+ samples 
- 
- Our Stats -> 
- On average, we send out around 10,000 boxes every month
- We have a feedback rate of 75%+ (# of users comments peak out at the beginning of the month, because we launch a new round of send-outs 😃 )
