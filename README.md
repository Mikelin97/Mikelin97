# Match Box Co. 

For the past 9 months, me and my friend Jay founded **Match Box🎁**, a platform that matches products to users through tagging algorithm and provide CEM-alike data analysis service to businesses. 

## Our Model 
- Match Box provides users with FREE consumer products samples such as, 
- 🍵 teabags, 🤚 hand sanitizer, 🍡 snacks, anything that you can imagine fitting in a box!!!
- After users received and tried out the products, they are prompted to answer a few 
- preset-comments covering basics: packaging, taste, willingness to purchase, etc. 
- Users are free to leave some comments as well~ 
- After receiving user feedbacks, we summarize and visualize the data for the 
- consumer brands who sponsored our products. 



## Our Growth 
- Within 5 months, we grew to 40k users, every month we experience a 100% growth! (afterall, who doesn't like FREE things hehe 😉 
- We worked with 15+ brands, each providing at least 500+ samples 


## Our Stats 
- On average, we send out around 10,000 boxes every month
- We have a feedback rate of 75%+ (# of users comments peak out at the beginning of the month, because we launch a new round of send-outs 😃 )
- We have arranged and sent out over 10,000 combinations of products to users
